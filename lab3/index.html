			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Lab 3's challenge was to create a local file sturture and an index.html file. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A challenge that I often encountered during this lab, was figuring out specifically what errors I made when the code was red. If me and my partner weren't able to figure out the issue, what we did was seach up the task I was having issues on and compare it to the outline W3Schools provided. Anything on W3Schools outline I didn't have were the adjustments I'd make to my code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was not as challenging as I made it out to be. It even became fun problem solving with my partner and because of this we didn't hesitate to invest additional time and energy into this assingment. </p>
